# Hi, I’m a first-year engineering student at IMT Atlantique 👋

I’m interested in **Machine Learning, applied mathematics, optimization, and modeling**.  
Below are a few projects i've developed mainly in **Python**.


---

###  No-Show Prediction Model (Healthcare Startup Prototype)

- Built a **no-show prediction model** for a women’s healthcare startup.
- Integrated the model into a **conversational prototype**:
  - A conversational assistant asks natural-language questions.
  - Relevant answers are mapped to model features.
  - The system outputs a **no-show probability** and a decision based on a configurable threshold.
- Optional explanation of likely contributing factors.

**Keywords:** machine learning, classification, decision thresholds

###  Thermal Simulation & CPU Geometry Optimization (TIPE)


- Developed a **thermal simulator for CPUs** based on physical heat transfer models.
- Implemented **geometric optimization of heat dissipation blocks**.
- Evaluated design choices through numerical simulations.
- Objective: improve thermal dissipation and justify results quantitatively in order to extend the lifespan of CPUs.

**Keywords:** thermal modeling, numerical simulation, optimization, physics-based modeling

###  3D Reconstruction from Images (Mobile Application) [In Progress]

- Developed a prototype application that:
  - Converts multiple images into a **3D scan**.
  - Generates a **3D model from a single image** by using LLM-generated views from additional angles.
- Pipeline combines image processing, geometry reconstruction, and generative modeling.

**Keywords:** computer vision, 3D reconstruction
