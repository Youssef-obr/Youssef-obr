## 🔬 Projects

### 🖥️ Thermal Simulation & CPU Geometry Optimization (TIPE)
**2024–2025 | CPGE TIPE – Morocco**

- Developed a **thermal simulator for CPUs** based on physical heat transfer models.
- Implemented **geometric optimization of heat dissipation blocks**.
- Evaluated design choices through numerical simulations.
- Objective: improve thermal dissipation and justify results quantitatively.

**Keywords:** thermal modeling, numerical simulation, optimization, physics-based modeling

### 🏥 No-Show Prediction Model (Healthcare Startup Prototype)

- Built a **no-show prediction model** for a women’s healthcare startup.
- Integrated the model into a **conversational prototype**:
  - A conversational assistant asks natural-language questions.
  - Relevant answers are mapped to model features.
  - The system outputs a **no-show probability** and a decision based on a configurable threshold.
- Optional explanation of likely contributing factors.

**Keywords:** machine learning, classification, decision thresholds, applied ML, healthcare

### 📱 3D Reconstruction from Images (Mobile Application)

- Developed a prototype application that:
  - Converts multiple images into a **3D scan**.
  - Generates a **3D model from a single image** by using LLM-generated views from additional angles.
- Pipeline combines image processing, geometry reconstruction, and generative modeling.

**Keywords:** computer vision, 3D reconstruction, generative models, applied AI
